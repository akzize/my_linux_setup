# My Linux Setup

This repository contains the configuration files and scripts for my personal Linux setup. It includes various dotfiles, custom scripts, and installation instructions to help me quickly set up my preferred development environment on any Linux machine.

Feel free to explore the different files and folders to see how I've customized my Linux setup. If you find anything useful, feel free to use it in your own setup as well.
